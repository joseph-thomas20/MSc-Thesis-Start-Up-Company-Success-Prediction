# Start-Up-Success-Prediction

This repository holds the code used in the creation of my thesis to complete my MSc in Economics and Data Science. 

The first notebook details the steps taken to clean the data, execute feature engineering and pre-process a large raw dataset ready for machine learning deployment. 

The second notebook explores the resampling methods used to overcome the 89% to 11% class imbalance of the target variable. The resampling techniques explored are Undersampling, Oversampling, SMOTE and ADASYN (An extension of the SMOTE technique that increases the scattered distribution of synthesised data points. 

The third notebook details the deployment of the classification methods that are the proxys for success prediction models. The notebook also includes the code used to derive the feature importance of the most accurate models. 

The full written thesis will be uploaded after the university have finished the marking process.
